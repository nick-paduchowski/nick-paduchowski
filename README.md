# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-paduchowski-111129203">Nick Paduchowski</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

I‚Äôm passionate about cybersecurity and thrive on solving complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection and incident response, I dive deep into real-world scenarios to enhance security operations and processes. My current focus is on cloud security and architecture, where I specialize in securing cloud infrastructures, managing identity and access, and building resilient, scalable security solutions for cloud environments. Through these projects, I aim to improve cloud security practices, ensure compliance, and mitigate modern cyber threats. Each project reflects my dedication to continuous learning and my goal of mastering cloud-native security. I invite you to explore my work, where you'll find security assessments, automation scripts, and cloud architecture designs that strengthen security in cloud-based systems. As I continue to grow in this field, I‚Äôm always eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to creating safer digital environments. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss security practices, share feedback, or explore opportunities together.
